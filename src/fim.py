To compute the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in PyTorch, you can follow these steps:

Define the likelihood function: This is specific to your problem and model.
Compute the gradient of the log-likelihood: Use PyTorchâ€™s automatic differentiation.
Calculate the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM): Use the gradients to form the FIM.
Compute the trace of the FIM: Sum the diagonal elements of the FIM.
